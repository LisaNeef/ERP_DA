\begin{abstract}
Changes in the Earth's rate of rotation and the orientation of its rotational pole, i.e the Earth Rotation Parameters, are observed regularly.
At timescales shorter than a few years, fluctuations in these parameters are largely driven by changes in atmospheric angular momentum, which implies that these observations contain useful information about the dynamics of the atmosphere.
It has therefore been proposed to assimilate these parameters into atmosphere and ocean models, as an additional observable constraint for prediction and model evaluation/
In this study we test this idea by performing Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs), using an Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter and the Community Atmosphere Model 5.
We show that the assimilation of atmospheric angular momentum, as observed via Earth rotation variations, is able to reduce large-scale error in the ensemble, even though the assimilated variables represent integrals of the atmospheric state.  
Error reduction is possible as long as the spread of the ensemble itself is relatively small, but this is a difficult condition to maintain if only global angular momentum functions are assimilated.
It is difficult to show that the assimilation of Earth rotation parameters / atmospheric angular momentum adds any value to the assimilation of more conventional, localized observations.
However, including atmospheric angular momentum in an assimilation experiment as evaluated variables only provides a useful measure for the fidelity of an assimilation system.  
The results found here could be extended to other cases where integral or averaged observations are assimilated.

\section{Introduction}

% common ground -- DA is now accessible for climate models and enables us to use a variety of osbservations to evaluate and constrain models
The assimilation of data into numerical models of the atmosphere and ocean has now evolved from its original purpose in numerical weather prediction, to the application in climate modeling. 
Data assimilatiom methods and codes are now accessible non-experts, in the form of out-of-the-box assimilation toos tools such as the Data Assimilation Research Testbed \citep[DART]{Anderson2009} or the Parallel Data Assimilation Framework \citep[PDAF]{Nerger2013}.

% CG zoomed in: earth rotation observations in particular have been found to deliver unique information about the atmosphere [examples...] -- it seems natural to use formal DA to really figure out what these obs have to say about our models, and in fact Saynisch et al have done this.
The evolution of data assimilation algorithms and tools enables us to use various observations of the Earth system to constrain and evaluate climate models.
Space geodesy, i.e. the measurement of the figure, position, and geoid of the Earth from satellites, very long baseline interferometry, and satellite and lunar laser ranging, offers a unique source of information about the Earth system.  

In particular, it has been found that the angular momenta of the atmosphere and ocean can be observed in terms of anomalies in the Earth's polar orientation and rotation rate, the so-called Earth Rotation Parameters (ERPs).
For example, \citet{Neef2014} showed that sudden stratospheric warmings are typically preceded by a circa 60 milli-arcsecond wobble in the polar orientation, 3-4 weeks before the warming onset.
\textcolor{alert}{[Insert another example of how the atmosphere has footprints in the ERPs.]}

It makes sense to ask whether more clear connections between observed Earth rotation variations and atmosphere/ocean models can be drawn by formally assimilating these parameters into models. 
This was done by \cite{Saynisch2011,Saynisch2010,Saynisch2012}, who assimilated the observed ERP timeseris into various ocean model simulations, found that the observations implied that large adjustments in the model's mass distribution and currents are are necessary in order for the modeled ocean angular momentum to agree with observations.
However, those studies did not show how much of this change was due to the addition of the integral observations, nor whether or not the ERP observations actually added information to gridpoint observations that were also assimilated.


% DC1: it's unclear whether integral observations can be useful constraints in the first place.
It is not clear whether observations like the ERPs can indeed usefully constrain the modeled state, because the ERPs represent integrals of the modeled wind (or current) and mass fields, rather than local quantities.
While the prospect of assimilating non-gridpoint observations like ERPs is an exciting possibility, these observations represent integrals of the model state and their assimilation with standard algorithms is therefore not straightforward.


An assimilation algorithm looks for an adjustment to a model that brings it closer to the observations being assimilated. 
However, even though the resulting model adjustment may improve the fit to the assimilated observations, it will not necessarily bring the modeled state closer to the truth.


%% PP1: in this paper we evaluate whether ERPs are suited for data assimilation and show some of the difficulties associated with assimilating an integral quantity
It is not sufficient to evaluate the fit between the model and the observations, since the assimilation algorithm is designed to fit the observations. In so-called Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) a model is used to simulate a "true" state, from which observations are generated and assimilated back into either the same or another model. OSSEs make it possible to evaluate an observation configuration and/or an assimilation technique because the true state is known, and can be directly compared to the analysis model state.
In this study we perform OSSEs, using the community data assimilation facility DART, to evaluate whether ERPs are suited for data assimilation and show some of the difficulties associated with assimilating an integral quantity as a model constraint.


%% DC2: In realstic experiments where we don't know the truth, we need to evaluate using indepenent variables, which can be hard to find.

In non-idealized assimilation experiments, it is difficult to judge whether the assimilation of a given set of observations has actually succeeded in bringing the estimated state closer to the truth. 
Here it is important to compare the assimilated state with independent observations. However, these are often difficult to obtain because different observing systems often don't overlap sufficiently in time and space.

%% PP2: ERPs are actually really well suited for this, because they represent 3 easy numbers that capture the entire model state.
In Section ** we demonstrate how the modeled excitation of Earth rotation variations by the angular momentum of the atmosphere can be used as a measure of the assimilation efficacy, by implementing atmospheric angular momentum as an evaluated but unassimilated observation in  DART.



%-------------------------------------METHODS-----------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Methodology}
Assimilation experiments are performed using the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter \citep[EAKF]{anderson2001} and the Community Atmosphere Model 5 \citep[CAM5]{nealeetal2010}, using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed \citep[DART]{Anderson2009, Raeder2012}.


\subsection{Atmospheric Model}
\label{sec:CAM}
CAM5 is run with the finite-volume dynamical core with a $1.9x2.5$ degree lat/lon horizontal resolution, and  30 hybrid-coordinate vertical levels, with a top near 3 hPa.
CAM5 forms the atmospheric component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM).

The top three model levels (starting at about 14 hPa) constitute a sort of ``sponge'' layer, where horizontal diffusion is applied to temperature, vorticity, and divergence in order to absorb vertically propagating planetary waves.  
The diffusion has been tuned in order to give a reasonable strength of the stratospheric polar night jets \citep{nealeetal2010}.




\subsection{Data Assimilation System}
Assimilations are performed using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART), an open-source, community facility that makes ensemble data assimilation available for any model, using any observations.
It is available online at \url{www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART}.
DART includes a variety of assimilation algorithms in the Ensemble Kalman Filter \citep{evensen2003} family.
Here we use the so-called Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF) of \citet{anderson2001}.

When an observation is made, the entire ensemble of model states is updated to improve the fit between what was observed, $y_{\text{obs}}$, and the prior observation value implied by the ensemble, $\left< y_{n,b} \right>$, where $n$ is the index over individual ensemble members and the brackets $\left< \cdot \right>$ represent the ensemble mean.

Bayes' theorem states that the conditional probability distribution of the estimated observation value, given the prior estimate supplied by the ensemble and the actual measurement, is the product of the  prior probability distribution for this observation,  and the probability distribution associated with the observation error.
This means that the updated ensemble error variance in the space of the observation $\sigma_a^2$, is a linear combination of the prior error variance of the observation (implied by the ensemble), $\sigma_b^2$, and the observation error variance, $\sigma_{\text{obs}}^2$:
\begin{eqnarray}
 \sigma_a^2 = 
\left[
\left( \sigma_b^2  \right)^{-1}+
\left( \sigma_{\text{obs}}^2  \right)^{-1}
\right]^{-1},
\label{eq:sigma_a}
\end{eqnarray}

The updated ensemble mean of the joint probability distribution is then given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\left< y_a \right> = \sigma_a^2 
\left(
\frac{\left< y_b \right>}{\sigma_b^2} +
\frac{y_{\text{obs}} }{\sigma_{\text{obs}}^2} 
\right).
\end{eqnarray}
Then the updated observation-space value of each ensemble member is given by 
\begin{eqnarray}
 y_{a,n} = 
\left( \frac{\sigma_a^2}{\sigma_b^2}  \right)
\left(
y_{b.n} - \left< y_b  \right> \right)
+ \left< y_a \right>,
\end{eqnarray}
i.e. a linear transformation of the ensemble members about the updated mean such that (\ref{eq:sigma_a}) is satisfied by the ensemble \citep{andersoncollins2006}.


Practically, of course, we don't update the observations implied by the ensemble, but rather the \textit{state} of each ensemble member.
The state vector of each ensemble member, ${\bf x}_n$, is updated simply by projecting the observation space update $\Delta y_n = y_{n,a}-y_{n,b}$ onto the individual state components $x_i$ via linear regression:
\begin{eqnarray}
 \Delta x_{i,n} = 
\left(
\frac{c_{x_iy}}{\sigma_b^2}
\right)
\Delta y_n,
\end{eqnarray}
where $c_{x_iy}$ represents the prior covariance between the state component $x_i$ and the observation $y$.

The novelty of ensemble assimilation algorithms is that the covariance $c_{x_iy}$ and the prior and posterior variances $\sigma_b^2$ and $\sigma_a^2$ are computed dynamically, using the ensemble of model states:
\begin{eqnarray}
c_{x_iy} &=& 
\left<
\left( x_i - \left< x_i \right>   \right)
\left( y - \left< y \right>   \right)
\right> 
\label{eq:covariance} \\
%
\sigma_b^2 &=& 
\left<
\left( y_{b,n} - \left< y_b \right>   \right)^2
\right>  
\label{eq:sigma_b} \\
%
\sigma_a^2 &=& 
\left<
\left( y_{a,n} - \left< y_a \right>   \right)^2
\right>  
\label{eq:sigma_a} 
\end{eqnarray}
%
Using the ensemble means that we capture (or attempt to capture) the dynamic nature of the error statistics in the model.

\subsection{Observations}

\textcolor{alert}{Insert introductory sentence about observations.}

\subsubsection{Atmospheric Angular Momentum Observations}
\label{sec:AAM}
We generate the atmospheric angular momentum (AAM) of the model state at each observation time, using the following non-dimensional equations derived by \citet{barnesetal1983}:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf \chi}_{1}(t) &=& \frac{1.608}{\Omega \left( C-A' \right)}
  \left[ 0.684 \Omega \Delta {\bf I}_{13}(t) + \Delta h_1(t)  \right] \label{eq:X1} \\
{\bf \chi}_{2}(t) &=& \frac{1.608}{\Omega \left( C-A' \right)}
  \left[ 0.684 \Omega \Delta {\bf I}_{23}(t) + \Delta h_2(t)  \right] \label{eq:X2}\\
{\bf \chi}_{3}(t) &=& \frac{0.997}{\Omega C_m}
  \left[ 0.750 \Omega \Delta {\bf I}_{33}(t) + \Delta h_{3}(t) \label{eq:X3} \right],
\end{eqnarray}
where $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ represent the angular momentum vector components defined by the intersection of the equator with the $180\degree$W and $0\degree$ meridians, respectively, and $\chi_3$ reprents the axial component.
The ${\bf I}_{ij}$ terms represent the components of the atmospheric inertia tensor:
\begin{eqnarray}
  I_{13} &=& -\int R^2 \cos \phi \sin \phi \cos \lambda dM 
  \label{eq:I1}\\
  I_{23} &=& -\int R^2 \cos \phi \sin \phi \sin \lambda dM 
  \label{eq:I2}\\
  I_{33} &=&  \int R^2 \cos^2 \phi dM ,
  \label{eq:I3}
\end{eqnarray}
and the $h_i$ terms the relative angular momentum (due to winds) in each direction:
\begin{eqnarray}
  h_{1}  &=& -\int R \left[u \sin \phi \cos \lambda - v \sin \lambda \right] dM 
    \label{eq:h1}\\
  h_{2}  &=& -\int R \left[u \sin \phi \sin \lambda + v \cos \lambda \right] dM 
    \label{eq:h2}\\
  h_{3}  &=&  \int R u \cos \phi dM.
    \label{eq:h3}
\end{eqnarray}
%
$R = 6371.0$ km is the radius of the Earth, $\Omega = 7.292115\times 10^{-5} \text{rad}/\text{s}$ the average rotation rate, and $g = 9.81 \text{m}/\text{s}^2$ is the acceleration due to gravity.
 $C = 8.0365 \times 10^{37} \text{kg} \text{m}^2$ and $A = 8.0101 \times 10^{37} \text{kg} \text{m}^2$ are the  axial and next-largest principal moments of inertia of the solid Earth, and $C_m = 7.1236 \times 10^{37} \text{kg} \text{m}^2$ is the principal inertia tensor component of the Earth's mantle \citep{gross2009}.

Note that the zonal integration in the axial AAM terms [(\ref{eq:I3}) and (\ref{eq:h3})] weights all longitudes equally.
In practice, this means that mass anomalies tend to cancel one another out in the zonal integral, with the result that the axial mass excitation (\ref{eq:I3}) is usually several orders of magnitude smaller than the axial wind excitation (\ref{eq:h3}) \citep{barnesetal1983}.

Nearly the opposite is true for the equatorial AAM terms [(\ref{eq:I1})-(\ref{eq:I2}) and (\ref{eq:h1})-(\ref{eq:h2})], where stronger zonal asymmetry in the wind and mass fields leads to a larger global integral.
For these functions, the mass terms [(\ref{eq:I1}) and (\ref{eq:I2})] typically outweigh the wind terms [(\ref{eq:h1}) and (\ref{eq:h2})] by a few factors \citep{barnesetal1983}.

As they are defined here, $\chi_1$ largely reflects surface pressure variations over the oceans, and $\chi_2$ over the continents.
Consequently, $\chi_2$ has a pronounced annual cycle due to the yearly appearance of the Siberian High \citep{dobslawetal2010}, and tends to show strong negative anomalies in the month preceding a sudden stratospheric warming \citep{Neef2014}.
$\chi_1$, in contrast, has much weaker subseasonal to annual variations, in part because surface pressure variations over the ocean tend to be evened out by corresponding displacements of the ocean surface (the so-called ``inversted barometer'' effect, e.g. \citet{salsteinrosen1989}).

In reality, of course, we don't measure the atmospheric angular momentum but rather the variations in the Earth rotation parameters that are excited by the above angular momentum functions.
Therefore in practice one would have to rotate the observed polar motion parameters into equivalent equatorial angular momentum components, convert observed length-of-day anomalies into corresponding axial angular momentum, and subtract out the excitation of each parameter that is due to other components of the Earth system.
For the purposes of this study, it is sufficient to assimilate the three AAM components directly, since we are performing perfect model experiments and therefore know the true state.
%---cut this part: since we assimilate the X's, we don't need to talk about polar motion
%The non-dimensional representation of AAM in (\ref{eq:X1})-(\ref{eq:X3}) makes it easy to map angular momentum changes to equivalent changes in the polar orientation (or polar motion) and the rate of Earth's rotation. 
%Polar motion is measured in terms of two angles, $p_1$ and $p_2$, that represent the location of the Earth's rotational axis in an inertial, celestial reference frame that is fixed in space and defined relative to a group of stars (the so-called celestial ephemeris pole).
%\citet{barnesetal1983} and later \citet{Gross1992} showed that these vectors can be directly related to unit variations in the equatorial components of the Earth's angular momentum ($\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$) via a rotation into the inertial reference frame of the so-called Chandler wobble (a free nutation of the Earth of frequency 
%$\sigma_0 = 2\pi/ 433\text{d}$, which results from the oblateness of the Earth's figure):
%\begin{eqnarray}
%  p_1 + \frac{\dot{p_2}}{\sigma_0} &=& \chi_1 \\
%  -p_2 + \frac{\dot{p_1}}{\sigma_0} &=& \chi_2.
%\label{eq:X12_to_PM}
%\end{eqnarray}
%where the overdots represent time derivatives, $\sigma_0 = 2\pi/ 433\text{d}$ denotes the Chandler frequency.

Nevertheless, it is conceptually helpful to transform the axial AAM function $\chi_3$ into corresponding anomalies in the length of a day ($\Delta$LOD), which is done using the following relationship:
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta \text{LOD} &=& \Delta \chi_3 \times \text{LOD}_0 ,
\label{eq:X3_to_LOD}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\text{LOD}_0$ denotes the nominal length-of-day (86400s).  
%----cut----The length-of-day anomalies are observed as $\Delta \text{LOD}  \equiv \text{UT1} - \text{IAT}$ where UT1 denotes the universal time measured by geodetic techniques and IAT is a reference time based on atomic clock measurements.



For our experiments, observations of $\chi_1$, $\chi_2$, and $\chi_3$ are generated every 24 hours, reflecting the observation frequency of the real ERP series released by Earth rotation services.  


\subsubsection{Idealized Radiosonde Observations}
\label{sec:radiosondes}

In order to evaluate  the assimilation of Earth rotation variations, we need to compare it to the assimilation of conventional, spatially-distributed observations such as are normally assimilated in the generation of atmospheric reanalysis \citep{Dee2005} or weather prediction models (\textcolor{red}{CITE}).
Since compiling all the available observations is a complicated task in itself, we simulate the conventional observation grid using an idealized, global grid of radiosonde-like observations.  

The horizontal grid of the radiosonde observations is shown in Figure \ref{fig:RS}.

\textcolor{red}{How many RS observations per day?}


\subsubsection{Synthetic GPS-RO Observations}
\label{sec:gpsro}

In Section \ref{sec:aam_as_evaluation_variable} we investigate the usefulness of AAM observations as an evaluated variable when spatially-localized observations are assimilated.  


\subsection{Perfect-model experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

We  perform so-called perfect-model experiments, wherein the ``truth'' is actually a model simulation, and observations are generated from this simulation with known error statistics, then assimilated back into the model.
Perfect model experiments are designed to show how much information can truly be recovered by assimilation in the absence of unknown model and obsersvation errors.
This is impossible to do with the assimilation of real observations, where the true state and the accuracies of the model and observation operators are not known.


\subsubsection{Ensemble Generation}
All assimilation runs were performed with an 80-member ensemble.
The ensemble is generated by selecting 80 random 1 January states from a long simulation of CAM5, and then running a year of assimilation of the radiosonde observations (Section \ref{sec:radiosondes}).


\subsubsection{Output Diagnostics}
Our main evaluation diagnostics are the square error between the simulated true state and the ensemble mean
\begin{eqnarray}
E_M = \left(
\left< x \right>-x_t
\right)^2
\end{eqnarray}
and the ensemble variance about its mean:
\begin{eqnarray}
S = 
\frac{1}{N}
\sum_{j=1}^N
\left(
\left< x_j \right>-x_t
\right)^2,
\end{eqnarray}
where $x$ represents the a component of the state vector in the ensemble,  $x_t$ a component of the true state, and $\left< \cdot \right>$ represents the ensemble mean.

To evaluate how much information is actually gained from assimilation in each case, we compare the the mean square error, $\llbracket E_M \rrbracket$ (where the brackets represent a spatial average) between the three assimilation experiments and the NoDA experiment.
To evaluate whether the ensemble is an accurate representation of the true uncertainty, we test whether the truth is indeed a sample of the probability distribution represented by the ensemble.
Here  we follow \citet{Huntley2009}, who used the theory of \citet{Murphy1988} that this is the case when 
\begin{eqnarray}
\llbracket E_M \rrbracket = \frac{N+1}{N} \llbracket S \rrbracket.
\label{eq:EvsS}
\end{eqnarray}

\textcolor{alert}{----Insert description of rank histograms and kurtosis measures, if used.}

\subsubsection{Experiment Overview}
% experiment types
Four assimilation experiments are performed, summarized in Table \ref{tab:expts}: In the first (NoDA), the 80-member ensemble is allowed to evolve without any assimilation. 
Only the three  AAM components are assimilated (12-hourly) in experiment AAM.  
In experiment RST, the temperature observations from the idealized radiosonde grid are assimilated 6-hourly.
In experiment RST+AAM, both the radiosonde temperatures and the AAM components are assimilated. 
Experiments NoDA and AAM were integrated for two months, 1 January to 28 February 2009.  
Exeperiments RST and RST+AAM were only integrated for the first 31 and 17 days of this period, respectively, because this amount of integration time was found to be sufficient to give the results presented in this study.

\section{AAM as an Assimilation Variable}

 



\input{results_erpda.tex}

\subsection{State-space diagnostics}
\label{sec:ERPALL}

\subsubsection{Error growth without assimilation}

It is useful to examine how the ensemble in our assimilation system spreads relative to the true state when no observations are assimilated, because this shows us what information can actually be gained from assimilating.
Figure \ref{fig:NODA}(a) compares the  mean square error  between the ensemble mean and the true state (MSE hereafter) to the  variance of the ensemble after it has been scaled by $(N+1)/N$, as in (\ref{eq:EvsS}).
The first row shows MSE and ensemble variance for the zonal wind, as a function of vertical level and time, averaging zonally and meridionally.  
The second row of plots compares the MSE and the scaled ensemble spread in the surface pressure, over latitude and time, averaging zonally.  

The first noticeable growth of the error and ensemble variance is around 250 hPa (i.e. near the altitudes of the extratropical jets) for zonal wind, and around the North Pole for surface pressure.
After about a month, the true error grows quite rapidly at the highest model levels, near the ``sponge'' layer (see Section \ref{sec:CAM}).
\textcolor{red}{[What is the physical explanation for these large errors?]}
Not counting the highest levels, both the MSE and the ensemble variance reach a steady state after roughly three weeks of integration.
While the the scaled ensemble variance is similar in magnitude to the MSE, it systematically underestimates the true error slightly for both variables. 
\textcolor{unsure}{The relative agreement between the growth of the true error and the ensemble spread isn't surprising, since in our case the``truth'' is actually a realization of the same model that produced the ensemble.}

\textcolor{alert}{[Here insert stuff about rank histograms, which show that the truth is a sample from the PDF represented by the ensemble, which is what we want.]}
In order for the assimilation experiments of the next section to be successful, they should achieve two goals: (1) to decrease the true error, and (2) to maintain an ensemble that comes from the same probability distribution of which the true state can also be considered a sample.

\subsubsection{Assimilation of AAM}

Figure \ref{fig:ERPDA_error_growth} compare the ensemble mean MSE and the scaled ensemble variance, as in Fig. \ref{fig:NODA}, but for the AAM experiment.  
Comparison between Figures \ref{fig:ERPDA_error_growth} and \ref{fig:NODA} shows that the assimilation of the three angular momentum functions slows down the initial growth of error and ensemble variance in both the wind and surface pressure.
However, the assimilation decreases the ensemble spread more strongly than the actual error.

This can be seen more clearly in Figure \ref{fig:ERPDA_diff}, which shows the MSE and variance of the AAM experiment minus that of the NODA experiment.
Here it is clear that while MSE in both variables is indeed reduced by the assimilation (negative values) sometimes, it is also increased be the assimilation at other times.
In contrast, the assimilation always decreases the ensemble variance
. 

In the global average (third column of Fig. \ref{fig:ERPDA_diff}), we see that the assimilation of the AAM functions is generally able to reduce the overall error in the wind fields for roughly the first 3 weeks of assimilation, but then begins to increase the true error.
In the surface pressure fields, the assimilation produces a global mean increase in the error starting as early as 10 days after the start of the experiment.

Figure \ref{fig:compare_divergence_basic} takes a closer look at the effect of AAM assimilation on the divergence of the ensemble filter, by comparing the difference between the MSE and the scaled variance with and without assimilation, again comparing the zonal wind and surface pressure.
For both variables, we can see that even when the difference between the true error and the ensemble variance is rather small, it is almost always larger when the three AAM components are assimilated. 
Divergence of the filter seems to be somewhat less severe for surface pressure, perhaps because it is a smaller field and thus slightly more easy to constrain with the three observations.

In summary, the assimilation of global AAM functions can lend some initial improvement to the estimated state, but ultimately leads to divergence of the ensemble filter.
This indicates that the covariance model, represented by the ensemble, is failing.  
In the following section, we investigate more closely why this happens, and how this result stems from the use of integral observations.



\subsection{Evolution of the  Covariance Field}

It was seen above that the ensemble filter is able to update the state more or less correctly at the beginning of the assimilation, actually makes the error between the ensemble mean and the true state worse later on in the assimilation period.
The degree to which each variable field is changed as the assimilation progresses depends on the covariances between local variables (in our case, winds or surface pressure) and the global AAM functions (\ref{eq:covariance}).
The covariance $c_{x_iy}$ is estimated for each state variable $x_i$ and each observation $y$ by the statistics of the model ensemble.  
A point in the model state can have a large covariance with the global AAM either if it has a large variance, or if it has a large correlation to the global AAM, or both.



\section{Can Earth rotation observations add value?}

The previous sections showed that the assimilation of AAM observations can reduce error in the modeled wind and pressure fields, as long as the ensemble spread has not reached its saturation level. 
Thus it makes sense to test whether the assimilation of AAM is more successful if the AAM functions are assimilated together with (more conventional) spatially localized observations to keep the ensemble spread from growing.

In terms of the AAM functions themselves [Fig. \ref{fig:fit_to_LOD}(d)] we saw that combining regularly-spaced observations with the AAM observations yielded an overal better-constrained state.
However, we found that the same is not true in terms of the model state variables. 
\textcolor{alert}{[Insert figure showing that adding AAM to local temperature observations increases the error while decreasing the spread.]}

Figure \ref{fig:compare_divergence_added_value} is similar to Fig. \ref{fig:compare_divergence_basic}, but now comparing experiment RST to experiment RST+AAM.
Again, we see that the consequence of adding AAM components as an assimilation variables is that the filter diverges, and here the effect is much stronger than in the basic experiment (Fig. \ref{fig:compare_divergence_basic}).
 

\section{AAM as an evaluation variable}

%% uncomment if we do end up showing something about gpsro
GPS-RO measurements have been shown to add a high amount of information to numerical weather forecasts (Bonavita, 2013), due to their low systematic errors and high vertical resolution. It was shown by (Wang et al., 2013) that GPS-RO data give an unprecedented look into the vertical structure of the atmosphere because of their high vertical resolution, in this case showing a warming trend in the tropopause inversion layer that would not have been observed otherwise.



%------------------------------------summary and conclusions-------------------------
\section{Summary}  

In this study we tested the efficacy of assimilating Earth rotation parameters, which represent changes in the atmospheric angular momntum and therefore integrals of the atmospheric wind and pressure fields.  
This was done by performing perfect model assimilation experiments wherein the three components of the global atmospheric angular momentum were assimilate, with and without complementary meteorological observations. 

It may be assumed that the assimilation integral quantities can lead to an overall improvement of a modeled atmosphere or ocean state.
Indeed, this was done by \citet{Saynisch2010,Saynisch2011,Saynisch2012} for Earth rotation parameters and by \textcolor{alert}{[CITE other examples of integral constraints]}.
However, we found that an improved state estimate is difficult to achieve when integral-type observations are assimilated, \textcolor{unsure}{because the assimilation decreases ensemble spread without improving the accuracy of the ensemble.}


It was found that the assimilation of the three components of AAM is able to decrease state error in an ensemble of simulations, but only during the initial spin-up period when both  the spread of the ensemble and the true error are quite small
As both the error and spread grow, it becomes too easy to fit the observed AAM without actually bringing the ensemble closer together.

In Kalman filter-based data assimilation, the state is adjusted most strongly in regions where the covariance between the state components and each observation is highest, which means that it depends both on the model spread at each point in the state vector, as well as the correlation of that point to the observation.  
Thus points with a large ensemble spread recieve a stronger adjustment than points with a smaller spread, which may not always reflect the true situation (i.e. points with a large true error are not adjusted enough), but as long as the correlation is estimated correctly, the adjustment will be made in the right direction.  

\textcolor{unsure}{The correlations should be estimated accurately if the model and observation operator are perfect and the ensemble is large enough (three conditions that are guaranteed in our experiments).  
However, our experiments showed that the modeled correlations between state components and the AAM observations become less and less accurate as the assimiliation progresses. 
This means that the ensemble becomes less and less represenative of the true error in time, i.e. that the truth and the forecast ensemble are no longer members of the same probability distribution. 
 }


These results lead to the possible conclusion that angular momentum oscillations might better constrain the state when assimilated in conjunction with local state observations that keep the spread in the ensemble small. 
However, we found that in this case, the additional assimilation of angular momentum degrades the analysis.    
\textcolor{alert}{Fill in the reason for this when I really understand it.}

There exists a potential way to assimilate integral observations, based on the study of \citet{Dirren2005}, but applying this method is doubtful to offer improvements upon the assimilation of other available observations, such as GPS-RO measurements.  
\textcolor{alert}{Need to explain why I think so.}


We have found that the real usefulness of Earth rotation observations is that they can measure the 
fidelity of a data assimilation system because they offer a  way to quantify the global state error in terms of three simple components that all reflect different things.
