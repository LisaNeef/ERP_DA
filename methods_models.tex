%-------------------CAM-------------------------
\subsubsection{CAM}
The Community Atmosphere Model 5 \citep[CAM5]{nealeetal2010}, forms the atmospheric component of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Earth System Model (CESM). 
We have run CAM with a finite-volume dynamical core, $1.9^{\text{o}} \times 2.5^{\text{o}}$ horizontal resolution, and  30 hybrid-coordinate vertical levels, the highest of which is near 2 hPa.
The top three model levels (starting at about 14 hPa) constitute a ``sponge'' layer, where horizontal diffusion is applied to temperature, vorticity, and divergence in order to absorb vertically propagating planetary waves.  
The diffusion has been tuned in order to give a reasonable strength of the stratospheric polar night jets \citep{nealeetal2010}.

%-------------------WACCM-------------------------
\subsubsection{WACCM}
The Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model \citep[WACCM]{Marsh2013} extends the dynamical core of CAM up to $5 \times 10^{-6}$hPa, which is in the lower thermosphere. 
The DART-WACCM simulations in this study were also run at $1.9^{\text{o}} \times 2.5^{\text{o}}$ horizontal resolution, with 66 vertical levels.
