%-------------------CAM-------------------------
CAM \citep{nealeetal2010} forms the atmospheric component of the NCAR Community Earth System Model (CESM). 
We have run CAM version 5.0 with a finite-volume dynamical core, $1.9^{\text{o}} \times 2.5^{\text{o}}$ horizontal resolution, and  30 hybrid-coordinate vertical levels, the highest of which is near 2 hPa.
The top three model levels (starting at about 14 hPa) constitute a ``sponge'' layer, where horizontal diffusion is applied to temperature, vorticity, and divergence in order to absorb vertically propagating planetary waves.  
%The diffusion has been tuned in order to give a reasonable strength of the stratospheric polar night jets \citep{nealeetal2010}.

%-------------------WACCM-------------------------
WACCM \citep{Marsh2013} extends the dynamical core of CAM up to $5 \times 10^{-6}$hPa, which is in the lower thermosphere, and includes additional chemical and physical processes for these regions. 
The experiments here use WACCM version 4.
%, from the CESM distribution 1.1.1 (\NCARFULL) and 1.2.0 (\WACCMNODA, \WACCMTROPICS, and \WACCMGLOBAL). 
WACCM's three highest model levels (starting from about $2 \times 10^{-5}$hPa) have strong horizontal diffusion to absorb planetary waves. 
%% Kevin Reader's answer about the WACCM sponge layers: 
%The number of damped levels depends on the dissipation choice in the WACCM atm_in namelist variable div24del2flag. For value 2 (ldiv2 diffusion) there are 3 damped levels. For values 4 and 42 (ldiv4 and ldiv4+ldel2) there are 4 damped levels.
%In addition, the advection operators go to first order for the top 1/8 of the levels, which is 8 for the 66 level model.  I believe that this is a gentler
The DART-WACCM simulations in this study were also run at $1.9^{\text{o}} \times 2.5^{\text{o}}$ horizontal resolution, with 66 vertical hybrid coordinate levels. 
%dissipation, so I think that we should set highest_state_pressure_Pa so that only levels 1-3 (or 4) feel no observations.
