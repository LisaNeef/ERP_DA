\section{Can Earth rotation observations add value?}

The previous sections showed that the assimilation of angular momentum observations can reduce error in the modeled wind and pressure fields, as long as the ensemble spread has not reached its saturation level. 
Thus it makes sense to test whether the assimilation of angular momentum is more successful if the angular momentum functions are assimilated together with (more conventional) spatially localized observations to keep the ensemble spread from growing.
