%\hl{AAM has been shown to be a useful variable because it sums up the atmosphere in just 3 variables that reflect a whole host of things.}
The global atmospheric angular momentum is a convenient variable to quantify the overall behaviour or atmospheric models, because it represents the integrated atmospheric mass and wind fields within three variables, which also happen to be observed at high accuracy in the form of variations in the Earth's rate of rotation and polar orientation.

%\hl{We show that it's also a really useful parameter for comparing the degree of constraint imposed by different DA setups.}
We demonstrate that the atmospheric angular momentum can also be used to measure how strong of a constraint is imposed by a data assimilation system, because it can be compared to Earth rotation parameter observations, which are independent of the meteorological observations that are typically assimilated.

%\hl{AAM is an appealing assimilation variable because it might constrain large scale structures -- but we illustrate here why that doesn't work.}
We test whether assimilating the atmospheric angular momentum can increase a model's agreement with reality. 
Using ensemble assimilation experiments with the Community Atmosphere Model 5 (CAM5), we show that  
assimilating the angular momentum can sometimes reduce the bias between the ensemble and the true state, but generally leads to filter divergence, with the ensemble clustering around a mean state that is farther from the truth than implied by the ensemble spread. 
This result suggests that observations that represent spatial or temporal averages are poor assimilation variables that lead to divergence of the assimilation system.
