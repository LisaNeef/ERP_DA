Having seen in Section \ref{sec:evaluation_variable} that Earth rotation parameters contain information about the atmospheric state, it seems natural to ask whether an atmosphere model could be constrained to the truth even more by assimilating these parameters. 
Experiments \NODA-\ERPRST ~address this question by assimilating synthetic observations of the angular momentum, as well as local temperature observations, using DART-CAM.
This analysis is similar to the studies of \citet{Saynisch2010,Saynisch2011} and \citet{Saynisch2012}, with two main differences:
(1) We use an atmosphere rather than an ocean model.
(2) We assimilate synthetic observations generated from a model simulation that serves as the ``true state''. 
This allows us to measure the true error, and 
also simulates an idealized situation where the atmosphere accounts for 100\% of Earth rotation variations, which means that our experiments do not require an estimate of the oceanic or hydrospheric contributions to Earth rotation variations.
