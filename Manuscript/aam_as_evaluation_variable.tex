\section{AAM as an evaluation variable}

%% uncomment if we do end up showing something about gpsro
GPS-RO measurements have been shown to add a high amount of information to numerical weather forecasts (Bonavita, 2013), due to their low systematic errors and high vertical resolution. It was shown by (Wang et al., 2013) that GPS-RO data give an unprecedented look into the vertical structure of the atmosphere because of their high vertical resolution, in this case showing a warming trend in the tropopause inversion layer that would not have been observed otherwise.
