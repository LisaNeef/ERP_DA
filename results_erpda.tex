\subsection{State-space diagnostics}
\label{sec:erpda}

To evaluate how the assimilation of the three angular momentum components changes the analysis (i.e. the ensemble mean state), we compare the unassimilated 80-member ensemble simulation to the experiment assimilating the three angular momentum components only.
