DART \citep{Anderson2009} is an open-source, community tool that provides ensemble-based data assimilation that is independent of a particular model and observation set.
Interfaces have been developed between DART and both CAM \citep{Raeder2012} and WACCM \citep{Pedatella2013}.

%-----WACCM experiments
\subsubsection{DART-WACCM Experiments}
Section \ref{sec:evaluation_variable} uses experiments \WACCMNODA-\WACCMGLOBAL~to examine how Earth rotation parameters reflect the constraint imposed by other observations in a data assimilation system.  
Experiment \WACCMNODA~runs a 40-member ensemble of WACCM simulations forward for six months starting on 1 Oct 2009, with no assimilation. 
\WACCMTROPICS~and \WACCMGLOBAL~use the same initial ensemble, but assimilate the meteorological observations that are also used in the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, i.e. winds and temperatures from radiosondes and aircraft \citep{Saha2010}, as well as refractivity profiles measured via GPS radio-occultation by the COSMIC satellite \citep{Anthes2008}.
The observations extend from the surface to about 2 hPa. 
\WACCMTROPICS~assimilates the observations only in the 30S-30N tropical band, while in \WACCMGLOBAL~assimilates over the entire globe.
Though experiments \WACCMNODA-\WACCMGLOBAL were run for six months, only the first 60 days of assimilation are discussed in this study.  

Experiments \WACCMTROPICS-\WACCMGLOBAL~both use a Gaspari-Cohn function \citep{Gaspari1999} to localize observations, with a half-width of 0.2 radians in the horizontal, and 0.5 scale heights in the vertical.  
Adaptive ensemble inflation \citep{Anderson2009tellus} is used to increase the ensemble spread when necessary; the inflation factor varies in space and time and is proportional to the distance between the ensemble mean and the observation, given the uncertainties of each.  
No analysis increment is allowed above 0.1 hPa, in order to prevent the generation of spurious gravity waves resulting from a large ensemble spread in the absense of upper level observations. 

%%---localization and inflation in Nick's 2014 paper: 
%Similar to Pedatella et al. [2013], the horizontal and vertical localizations are specified with a Gaspari-Cohn function [Gaspari and Cohn, 1999]
%with half widths of 0.2 radians and 0.5 in ln(pâˆ•p0) coordinates, respectively. Spatially and temporally varying adaptive inflation is used to inflate the ensemble prior to the assimilation in order to prevent collapse of the model spread [Anderson, 2009].

%%---localization and inflation in Nick's 2013 paper: 
%The most notable change is that we specify the ver- tical localization using a Gaspari-Cohn function [Gaspari and Cohn, 1999] with a half width of 0.5 in ln(p/p0) coor- dinates, where p is pressure and p0 is the surface pressure. This differs from the vertical localization of 1000 hPa in p used by Raeder et al. [2012]. 

%-----CAM5 experiments
\subsubsection{DART-CAM Experiments}
Experiments \NODA-\ERPRST ~(Table \ref{tab:expts}) are performed using DART-CAM.  
An 80-member ensemble of CAM states was generated by selecting the 1 Jan restart files from an 80-year CAM simulation, and assimilating 6-hourly synthetic temperature and wind observations on a uniform grid (roughly 27000 observations at a time) for an entire year. 
% extra info: the obs are assimilation at about 1800 locations on the globe and 15 levels ranging from the surface to 5 hPa
This roughly simulates reanalysis-type observations, and yields a tightly-constrained starting ensemble on 1 Jan 2009.  

A reference CAM simulation, run from Jan - Feb 2009 with observed sea surface temperatures as a boundary condition, constitutes the ``truth'' from which we generate a set of synthetic observations for assimilation. 
From this truth, we generate synthetic observations of $\chi_1$, $\chi_2$, and $\chi_3$ every 24 hours, reflecting the observation frequency of the real Earth rotation data series published by the International Earth Rotation Services \citep{iers}, as well as the synthetic reanalysis-type observations described above. 
The angular momentum observations are generated with zero observation error, in minimize sampling error effects and simulate an ideal situation where the Earth rotation parameters perfectly capture the atmospheric angular momentum. 
(Separate experiments testing various values of observation error did not significantly change the results described below.)  

\NODA ~integrates the CAM ensemble forward over Jan and Feb 2009 without data assimilation. 
In \ERPALL, the ensemble is run forward as before, but assimilating synthetic angular momentum observations every 12 hours.
\RST ~assimilates only the temperature observations.
\ERPRST ~assimilates both the temperature observations and the three global angular momentum components.
\RST~ and \ERPRST~ only ran for 31 and 17 days, respectively, because this amount of integration time was found to be sufficient to compare the relative error reduction in the two experiments.
