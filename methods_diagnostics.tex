Our main evaluation diagnostics are the square error between the simulated true state and the ensemble mean
\begin{eqnarray}
E_M = \left(
\left< x_i \right>-x_{i}^{t}
\right)^2
\end{eqnarray}
and the ensemble variance about its mean:
\begin{eqnarray}
S = 
\frac{1}{N-1}
\sum_{n=1}^N
\left(
	\left< x_{i}^{n} \right>-x_i^t
\right)^2,
\label{eq:spread}
\end{eqnarray}
where $x_{i}$ represents a component of the state vector in the ensemble,  $x_{i}^t$ and $x_{i}^n$ the corresponding component in the truth and individual ensemble members, respectively.

To evaluate whether the ensemble accurately represents the true uncertainty, we  test whether the truth can be considered a sample of the probability distribution represented by the ensemble.
 \citet{Huntley2009} and \citet{Murphy1988} pointed out that this is the case when 
\begin{eqnarray}
\llbracket E_M \rrbracket = \frac{N+1}{N} \llbracket S \rrbracket, 
\label{eq:EvsS}
\end{eqnarray}
where the square brackets represent spatial averages. 

A second way to quantify whether the ensemble and the truth come from the same probability distribution is via a rank histogram \citep[and references therein]{Hamill2001}
A rank histogram is generated by ordering the values of the ensemble at each point in the state space, and then finding the rank of some verification value on this list.
In our case, we simply use the true state as the verification, since it is known,
and then count this rank up all state space pointsd in a histogram. 
If the truth comes from the same distribution as the ensemble, the rank histogram should be nearly flat.  
If the truth is a frequent outlier of this distribution, the rank histogram will by concave.
A convex rank histogram indicates an ensemble whose spread is so large that the truth is usually the central rank.
